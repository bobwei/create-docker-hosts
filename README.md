# README

create-docker-hosts is a tool used to create docker hosts from script.


## Usage

Just run install.sh on your vms to run docker engine on the host.

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Notes

Current version of install.sh runs docker daemon in http mode resulting in insecure settings. So please run your docker hosts in internal network.
